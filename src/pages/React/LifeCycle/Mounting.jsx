            <p>In this phase the component is inserted into the DOM.</p>

                    <h2>constructor method</h2>
                    <p>Is the FIRST method called during the mounting phase.</p>
                    <p>This method is mostly used for initializing the state of the component and binding event-handler methods 
                        within the component.</p>
                    <p>The constructor method is not necessarily required. If you don't intend to make your component 
                        stateful (or if that state doesn‚Äôt need to be initialized) or bind any method, then it‚Äôs not 
                        necessary to implement.</p>
                    <p>YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL when you initialize state from props in constructor. Even if props changed 
                        to new one, the state wouldn't be changed because mount never happen again.
                        So getDerivedStateFromProps exists for that.</p>

                    <p>The getDerivedStateFromProps method is a static method, which means it's called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.</p>
                    <p>Is called after the constructor and before render().</p>
                    <p>This method is called for every render cycle and provides an opportunity to update the component's
                        state based on changes in props before the initial render.</p>
                    <p>Accepts two arguments: props and state, and returns an object, or null if no change is needed.</p>
                    <p><strong>static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)</strong></p>
                    <p>These values are passed directly to the method, so there‚Äôs no need for it to have access to the 
                        instance of the class and thus is considered a static method.</p>
