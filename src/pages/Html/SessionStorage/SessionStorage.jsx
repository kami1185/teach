        <p>It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the client's computer in the form of 
            key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless 
            the user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes 
            the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's 
            memory is cleared.
